# TODO
- Make ITNC instagram active again (WIP):
    - learn more about instagram algorithm (engagement)
    - learn how to post without getting compressed (seems to be fine now)
- Make ITNC discord active again:
    - currently too quiet and calm, need to be more active
    - serves little purpose, so we need to find other purpose of this server (e.g. project discussion, QnA with mentor, etc)
- Make ITNC github repository (WIP):
    - make it more populated with docs, syllabus, projects, and other things
