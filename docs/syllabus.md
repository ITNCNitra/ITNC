# Syllabus
To teach ITNC members based on active learning and project
> Projects aren't just work, they're more fun when shared. - kemtan

## Esports
- N/A

## Robotics
Teach members of ITNC about robotics. It mostly consist of Arduino and ESP32 or 8266 projects. What u should do as a mentor:
- make them learn more about the project, there is no teacher here, every one learn, the same goes to the mentor.
- based on projects (e.g. 2wd robot, claw arm robot, etc)
- let them google by themself, AI is okay when not used entirely and people understand the code
- helping them is a critical part of the subject

Material:
- C++ (obviously)
- make sure everyone or atleast half of the class understand basic code
- have all of the project component (microcontroller, chasis, module, etc) ready
- group people to what they want, they will try to contribute based on their own preference, for example:
    - group 1: assemble the chasis
    - group 2: understand the code and how it works
    - collab (1 and 2): assemble the chasis and microcontroller together 

## Programming
Here i think there is something that can be improved because we often copy paste material instead of code like we want to, we should give project which should be more engaging and fun. Here is what we should do as a mentor:

improvement:
 - more project based, less copy pasting mentors work, make them think how to make it (google is allowed, AI is allowed partially (no plek ketiplek), and docs is recommended).
 - make them think what project they want and is it doable, you as the mentor decide if its possible or not (tell them why, and approve the project if it meets all criteria)

 Material:
 - C++ [why? because C++ is staticly type (they have data type (int, double, string/char*, bool)) language] it will be much more easier to learn all the types of data in code
 - Python [why? because python have a load ton of modules where we can scrape data, make it into a chart, and export it. we can also pull huge/hidden data via api]

 ## Timeline:  
preference, but this is kemtan's timeline:  
- Esport: ML
- Robotics:
    - 2WD Driver robot
        - chasis and microcontroller assembly, concurrently, and two group collab to make the full robot
    - claw arm robot
        - reverse engineer how the robot works
- Programming:
    - C++
        - variable
        - data type
        - cin and cout
        - code order (define, input, prosess, ouput)
        - looping (for and while loop)
        - function
        - header file
            > note: try to make it into a project (e.g. print ITNC, convert data type, etc)
    - python
        - data scraping project
            - data via static file (html)
            - get data via api (didn't have time to share this yet)
    - HTML, CSS, JS
        - web development (make ITNC website or contribute here)
            - explain HTML (structure)
            - CSS (styling)
            - JS (dynamic and function)

> Thats all that i can share, i hope its helpful for future ITNC mentor, I wish u all the best
