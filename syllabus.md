# Syllabus
To teach ITNC members based on active learning and project
> Projects aren't just work, they're more fun when shared. - kemtan

## Esports
- N/A

## Robotics
Teach members of ITNC about robotics. It mostly consist of Arduino and ESP32 or 8266 projects. What u should do as a mentor:
- make them learn more about the project, there is no teacher here, every one learn, the same goes to the mentor.
- based on projects (e.g. 2wd robot, claw arm robot, etc)
- let them google by themself, AI is okay when not used entirely and people understand the code
- helping them is a critical part of the subject

## Programming
Here i think there is something that can be improved because we often copy paste material instead of code like we want to, we should give project which should be more engaging and fun. Here is what we should do as a mentor:

improvement:
 - more project based, less copy pasting mentors work, make them think how to make it (google is allowed, AI is allowed partially (no plek ketiplek), and docs is recommended).
 - make them think what project they want and is it doable, you as the mentor decide if its possible or not (tell them why, and approve the project if it meets all criteria)
